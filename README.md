# Artemis Financial Security Report

## Client Overview
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations by adding a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications.

## Software Requirements
Artemis Financial required a data verification step in the form of a checksum for secure data transfer. The web application needed to convert HTTP to HTTPS protocol to meet the company's security requirements.

## Project Highlights
### Software Security Vulnerabilities
- Identified and mitigated several security vulnerabilities within the client's software.
- Implemented secure coding practices to enhance the overall security posture of the application.

### Importance of Secure Coding
- Secure coding is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- Enhances the trust and reliability of the software, protecting the company's data and reputation.

### Challenges and Learnings
- Conducting the vulnerability assessment was challenging but essential to identify potential security gaps.
- Learning to increase layers of security by implementing HTTPS and ensuring data integrity through checksum verification.

### Security Enhancements
- Converted HTTP protocol to HTTPS for secure communication.
- Added checksum verification to ensure data integrity.

### Functional and Security Testing
- Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the software was both functional and secure.
- Verified the absence of new vulnerabilities after refactoring the code.

### Tools and Practices
- Utilized tools such as dependency-check to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Followed industry best practices for secure coding.

### Future Applications
- This project demonstrates my ability to perform vulnerability assessments and implement secure coding practices.
- I would showcase this work to future employers to demonstrate my skills in ensuring software security.
